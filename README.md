# Easy Ascii Strings

A small collection of convenient functions for manipulating ascii-only strings in C++.

I made this largely because I find myself remaking/reusing these functions often so, rather than constantly remake them for each individual project, I decided to compile a micro library for my uses.

**Thanks for reading.**
