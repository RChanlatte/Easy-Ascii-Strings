I tested this using both G++ and MSVC.

As far as G++ goes, you would compile this through the command line in a similar manner to most other statically linked libraries:

g++ <your-file>.cpp ezStr.a

It comes prepackaged with a testLib.cpp file in the src directory. If you wish to try it out, follwing the format above, we'd type in our commandline:

g++ testLib.cpp ezStr.a

*NOTE* If there are any .dll errors, you might have to append <-lstdc++> in between <your-file>.cpp and ezStr.a

When it comes to MSVC, you need to go within the project settings of your friendly Visual Studio solution:
