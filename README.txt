This is just a micro (if even that) library with a handful of functions that I find myself frequently creating whenever I make even trivial C++ functions. At the behest of a senior developer, I was informed to compile my own library of functions I find myself reiterating often. 

So, without further ado, here is a small ASCII-based library that makes wrappers for usually verbose functions or tedious, but useful, operations. I will continue to add additional functionality to this library if I deem it necessary (if I forget something or I encounter a bug). Until then, I hope everyone enjoys the library, whomever may stumble upon it.

Thanks for reading.
